# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns

A deep learning project whose main objective is to create a neural network that predicts the number of bike rides a DC's metro bike sharing system is expected to have at any given hour. Allocating bikes efficiently to meet demand is crucial for revenue generation & even more crucial is having an intelligent predicting system. The neural network can predict with an accuracy of over 80%, a great score for this task.
